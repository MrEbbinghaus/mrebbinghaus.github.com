      <![CDATA[<p><strong>Authors</strong>: <a class="author" href="mailto:ebbinghaus@hhu.de">Björn Ebbinghaus</a>, Martin Mauve</p><p><a href='https://wwwcn.cs.uni-duesseldorf.de/publications/publications/library/Ebbinghaus2020a.pdf'>PDF</a></p><p><div class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9"> <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Owexcgd5pOU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> </div></p><h2>Introduction</h2><p>With <i>decide</i> we want to enable a large crowd of participants to decide on a complex issue, such as how to make the best use of a given budget. In particular, we are interested in understanding how online argumentation and online prioritization schemes can be combined to support collective decision-making.</p><p>We have used decide to let our students collectively decide on how to use a real-world budget to improve the computer science course of study at HHU<!&ndash;\cite{Ebbinghaus2019a}&ndash;>. In our demo we will show the setup used in that experiment and report on the outcome.</p><h2>The <i>decide</i> collective decision system</h2><p><i>decide</i> employs a three-step approach to collective decision-making. In the first step participants can introduce proposals. For each proposal an estimated cost is provided by that participant. All participants then use dialog-based argumentation<!&ndash;\cite{Krauthoff2018b}&ndash;> to argue about the validity and priority of the proposals. <!&ndash;This is shown in \autoref{fig:dbas-decide}.&ndash;></p><p>In the second step the proposals are validated. That is to say in our specific experiment we checked if there are any reasons why any of the proposals cannot be realized even if the proposed resources were allocated to it. For example, one proposal required significant construction work which was not feasible. The remaining proposals with the attached argumentation then enter the next step.</p><p>In the final step the participants prioritize the proposals. First, the participants select the proposals that they want to support. Then they order the supported proposals by their own priority <!&ndash;(see \autoref{fig:decide-example})&ndash;>. The arguments attached to the proposals can be viewed and extended in this phase, but no new proposals can be created. The final result is then calculated using a truncated Borda count followed by a greedy collection of proposals which fit the budget.</p><h2>Future Work</h2><p>We have received valuable feedback from the students who used <i>decide</i>. One main issue is that dialog-based argumentation tends to involve the participant in a lengthy exchange of pro and contra arguments. This is good to gain an in-depth understanding of all positions, but it makes it hard to gain a quick overview of the main points. One main issue is therefore to improve the argumentation step and also to test other approaches &ndash;– such as nested pro and contra lists.</p><p>A second issue is the algorithm used to reach a decision. We would like to experiment with other voting schemes and see which of those are considered to be fair by the participants.</p>]]>

      <![CDATA[<p>As a programmer who tries to use <a href="https://clojure.org/" rel="nofollow">Clojure</a><a href="https://clojurescript.org/" rel="nofollow">(Script)</a> wherever possible, I am a frequent visitor of the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Dusseldorf-Clojure-Meetup" rel="nofollow">Clojure Meetup Düsseldorf</a>.
Recently I was asked what clojure tools/libraries I am using, worth sharing. It happens that a couple of days before, I came in contact with <a href="https://github.com/clojure/core.async">core.async</a> while writing a single page application in clojurescript.
One thing led to another, and I agreed to talk about <a href="https://github.com/clojure/core.async">core.async</a> at the next meetup.</p>
<p>As a novice in <a href="https://github.com/clojure/core.async">core.async</a> myself, this was an interesting task ahead.
Having to read a paper about <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=502057" rel="nofollow">staged event driven architecture</a> for the lecture <em>Architecture of Distributed Systems</em> introduced me to the advantages of separate running threads and the communication between via queues/channels between them.</p>
<p>After the talk we played around a little with a playground I developed, to test <a href="https://github.com/clojure/core.async">core.async</a> in a scenario of an ant colony.
This playground has the goal to make everything asynchronous, which maybe wasn't an ideal use of async, but it was fun at least to watch the little ants run around.
The code can be found on <a href="https://github.com/clojuredus/async-ants">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>All in all it was a nice evening, and I hope the listeners have learned something they can use to build great software. If I'm stumbling over something in the future I will definitely consider sharing it on a meetup again.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.invision.de/" rel="nofollow">InVision</a>, which hosted the event and provided us with drinks and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/invision_chefs/" rel="nofollow">great food</a>.
